## Example

**The Happy Trash Truck**

**by Dan Smith**

**Once upon a time,** there was a trash truck that was always happy. It loved to drive around picking up trash and taking it to the dump. It was always happy, no matter what.

One day, the trash truck was driving around picking up trash when it saw a little girl crying. The trash truck decided to stop and see what was wrong.

The little girl was crying because she had lost her doll. The trash truck felt bad for the little girl and decided to help her find her doll.

The trash truck drove around the neighborhood until it found the little girl's doll. The trash truck was so happy that it could help the little girl.

The trash truck is always happy because it knows that it can make a difference in the world, even if it's just picking up trash.
