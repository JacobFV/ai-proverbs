**Respect for All**

This is a story about a man who was very disrespectful. He would often say hurtful things to people and he never seemed to care about anyone's feelings but his own.

One day, he met a woman who was the complete opposite. She was always kind and considerate of others. She never said anything that would hurt someone's feelings.

The disrespectful man was amazed by this and asked the woman what her secret was. She replied, "I treat everyone with respect, no matter who they are. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect."

The disrespectful man was so moved by this that he decided to change his ways. From that day forward, he started treating everyone with respect. And he was finally happy.

This story shows that respect is one of the most important things in life. When we treat others with respect, we are also respecting ourselves.
