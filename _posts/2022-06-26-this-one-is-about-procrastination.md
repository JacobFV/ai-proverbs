**This one is about procrastination**

The sound of the alarm clock was like a dagger to Sarah's heart. She wanted nothing more than to hit the snooze button and go back to sleep. However, she knew that if she did that, she would be late for work again. And, if she was late for work one more time, her boss would surely fire her.

**So, Sarah decided to get out of bed.** It was hard at first, but she told herself that she could do it. She took a deep breath and slowly got out of bed. Once she was up, she began getting ready for her day.

Sarah's story is a reminder that we all have the power to control our impulses. With a little bit of effort, anyone can learn to exercise self-control and overcome procrastination.
