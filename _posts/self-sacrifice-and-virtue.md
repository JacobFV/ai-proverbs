**Self sacrifice and virtue**

This is a story about a man who is always trying to help others. The man is always giving his time and energy to help others, and he never seems to get anything in return. The man's friends and family are always telling him that he should stop helping others and start thinking about himself.

One day, the man meets a woman who is also always helping others. The two of them become friends, and the man starts to help the woman. The woman is very grateful, and the two of them start to help more and more people.

The man's friends and family are still telling him to stop helping others and to start thinking about himself, but the man doesn't listen. He knows that by helping others, he is making the world a better place.

The moral of the story is that self-sacrifice is a virtue.
