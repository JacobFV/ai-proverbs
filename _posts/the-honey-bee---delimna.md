**The Honey Bee 🐝 Delimna**

This is a story about a hardworking honey bee who is trying to make enough honey to last the winter. The bee works tirelessly, but her hive is constantly being raided by a group of bears. The bee asks the bears to stop, but they just laugh and continue to take her honey. The bee is devastated and doesn't know what to do.

One day, the bee comes up with a plan. She makes a giant pot of honey and hides it in the forest. The bears find the pot and start to eat, but the bee stings them all. The bears are so angry that they chase the bee back to her hive and destroy it. The bee is heartbroken, but she knows that she has to start again.

**What is the moral of the story?:**

The moral of the story is that hard work pays off, and that even when things are tough, you should never give up.
