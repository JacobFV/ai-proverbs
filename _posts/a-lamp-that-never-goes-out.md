**A Lamp that** never goes out

This is a story about a lamp that is always burning. The lamp is in a room that is full of people who are fighting and arguing. The people are so busy fighting that they don't even notice the lamp.

One day, a man comes into the room and sees the lamp. He is surprised that the lamp is still burning, and he starts to talk to the people about it. The man tells the people that the lamp is a symbol of hope, and it reminds the people that there is always light in the world.

The people are surprised, and they start to listen to the man. The man tells the people that the lamp can never be extinguished, and it will always be there to remind the people of the hope that is in the world.

The moral of the story is that hope is always present in the world, even in the darkest of times.
