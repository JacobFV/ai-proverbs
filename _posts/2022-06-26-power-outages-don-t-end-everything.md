**Power outages don't end everything**

This is a story about a city that is hit by a storm. The storm knocks out the power, and the city is plunged into darkness. The people of the city are scared and don't know what to do.

One man decides to go out and see if he can help. He starts to go from house to house, helping people to find their way in the darkness. The man is tired and hungry, but he doesn't stop until he has helped everyone he can.

The next day, the power comes back on, and the city is bright again. The people are very grateful to the man who helped them in the darkness.

The moral of the story is that even when things are tough, there are always people who are willing to help.
