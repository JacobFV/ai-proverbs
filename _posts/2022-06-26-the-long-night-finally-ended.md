**The Long Night finally ended**

This is a story about a world that is plunged into darkness. The darkness is so complete that the people can't see their own hands in front of their faces. The people are scared and don't know what to do.

One man decides to go out into the darkness and see if he can find a way to bring back the light. The man is scared, but he knows that he has to try. The man walks for days, and finally he sees a light in the distance. He knows that he has found the way back to the light, and he starts to walk towards it.

The moral of the story is that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.
