**Bart the Dog**

**This is a story** about a dog named Bart. Bart is a very loyal dog, and he always tries to help his owner. 

One day, Bart's owner went to work and left Bart at home. Bart was very bored, so he decided to go for a walk. Bart walked and walked until he came to a park. In the park, Bart saw a little girl playing by herself. The little girl was crying, and Bart could tell she was very sad. 

Bart walked up to the little girl and sat down next to her. He leaned against her and let her know he was there for her. The little girl stopped crying and petted Bart. She was so happy to have a new friend.

Bart and the little girl played together in the park all day. They had so much fun! Bart was so happy that he could make the little girl smile.

When it was time to go home, Bart walked the little girl home. He made sure she got home safely before he went home himself. 

Bart is a very loyal dog, and he will always try to help anyone in need.

**The moral** of this story is to be kind to others.
