**Write one more story about self-control; this time, make it about a woman who is struggling to give up her love of shopping**

Shopping was always therapeutic for Sarah. Whenever she felt stressed or down, she would go to the mall and buy herself something nice. It made her feel better in the moment, and it was a way to reward herself for working hard. However, Sarah also knew that shopping was not good for her finances. She knew that if she kept spending money on unnecessary things, she would eventually find herself in debt.

So, Sarah made a decision. She was going to learn self-control when it came to shopping. She started by making a list of what she needed before going to the store. This helped her stay focused and only buy what she needed. Additionally, Sarah began setting limits for herself on how much money she could spend per month on non-essential items.

**One day**, Sarah went to the mall with her list in hand and stuck to her budget. It was a proud moment for her, and she realized that she could do it. She didn't need to spend money to make herself feel better. She had the power of self-control.

Sarah's story is a reminder that we all have the ability to control our impulses. With a little bit of effort, anyone can learn to exercise self-control.
