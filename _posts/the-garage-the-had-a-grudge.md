**The Garage the Had a Grudge**

This is a story about a garage that had a grudge. It was always getting into arguments with the other garages in the neighborhood. It would complain about how they were parked, how they looked, and how they smelled. The other garages would try to be nice to the garage, but it was never enough.

One day, the garage snapped. It couldn't take it anymore. It went on a rampage, smashing all of the other garages in the neighborhood. It felt good to finally let out all of its anger.

Now, the garage is all alone. It's the only one left standing. And it's still angry.

**The moral** of the story is that anger can lead to isolation.
