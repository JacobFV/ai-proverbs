**Write a story about self-control as a woman struggles (victoriously!) with her love of ice cream**

Once upon a time, people believed that self-control was an innate quality. Some people were born with it, and others were not. However, recent studies have shown that self-control is actually a skill that can be learned.

One woman who learned this lesson the hard way was Sarah. Sarah loved ice cream. She loved the way it tasted, the way it made her feel, and the fact that it was always there for her when she needed it. However, Sarah also knew that ice cream was not good for her health. She knew that if she ate too much of it, she would gain weight and eventually become unhealthy.

So, Sarah made a decision. She was going to learn self-control. She was going to start by eating only one scoop of ice cream per day. This was hard for Sarah at first, but she persevered. She told herself that she could have ice cream tomorrow if she was good today. And, slowly but surely, she began to see results. She started losing weight and feeling better about herself.

Sarah's story is a testament to the power of self-control. If she can do it, anyone can!
