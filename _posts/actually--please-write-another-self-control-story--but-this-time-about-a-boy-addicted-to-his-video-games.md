**Actually, please write another self-control story, but this time about a boy addicted to his video games**

**Beep, boop**. Beep, boop. The sound of the computer game was like music to Tommy's ears. He loved everything about video games: the graphics, the challenges, and the fact that he could escape into another world whenever he wanted. However, Tommy also knew that video games were not good for his health. He knew that if he played too much, he would eventually become unhealthy.

**One day the power went out.** Tommy was bored and had nothing to do. He thought about all the fun he could be having if he was playing his video game right now. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head. Tommy decided that he was going to use this time to break his addiction to video games.

He started by setting limits for himself on how much time he could spend playing each day. Additionally, Tommy began doing other activities that he enjoyed, like reading and spending time outside. Slowly but surely, Tommy began to see results. He started feeling better about himself and realized that he didn't need video games in order to have fun.

**By the time** the power came back on, Tommy was a changed person. **No more** would he be controlled by his addiction to video games. He had the power of self-control.
