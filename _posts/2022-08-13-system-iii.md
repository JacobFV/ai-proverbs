## Take 1/3

**Psychologists like to talk about System I and System II.** The first is your emotional, intuitive brain, the one that operates on autopilot, and the second is your logical, analytical brain, the one that you have to activate to solve complex problems. **However, few give serious consideration to a proposed System III.** This is the system that makes plans and sets goals, that is, self-control. For the most part, the self-control system is shut off, but it can be activated. And it is, in fact, the key to all success.

The self-control system consists of three parts. The first is the ability to recognize that you have a problem, that is, to see the future consequences of your current choices. The second is the ability to refrain from immediate gratification and to resist temptation. The third is the ability to make a plan and to stick to it. Each of these parts is essential, but the third is the hardest.

The ability to see the future consequences of your choices is not a matter of intelligence. It is a matter of experience. The more you have experienced the pain of bad choices, the more likely you are to see the future consequences of your current choices. The ability to refrain from immediate gratification is not a matter of willpower. It is a matter of having a clear goal. When your goal is clear, it is easier to resist temptation. The ability to make a plan and to stick to it is a matter of self-control.

Self-control is like a muscle. It gets stronger with use and weaker with disuse. The more you use it, the easier it becomes to use it. The less you use it, the harder it becomes to use it.

The key to developing self-control is to set small, achievable goals. The more success you have in achieving your goals, the more self-control you will develop. The more self-control you have, the more likely you are to achieve your goals.

The best way to set small, achievable goals is to use a system called "habit stacking." This is a system of linking your new habit to an existing habit. For example, if you want to develop the habit of exercising, you could link it to the habit of brushing your teeth. Every time you brush your teeth, you would also exercise for one minute.

The key to habit stacking is to start small. One minute of exercise is not going to make you fit, but it is a start. And it is much easier to do one minute of exercise than it is to do an hour.

The key to success is to start small and to build up gradually. The best way to fail is to try to do too much too soon.

The best way to develop self-control is to use a system of graduated goals. This is a system of setting progressively more difficult goals. For example, if you want to develop the habit of exercising, you could start with a goal of walking for one minute. Once you have achieved that goal, you could set a goal of walking for two minutes. Once you have achieved that goal, you could set a goal of walking for three minutes, and so on.

**System III** is the key to success. It is the key to developing self-control. It is the key to setting and achieving goals. It is the key to living a happy and successful life.

## Take 2/3

**Psychologists like to talk about System I and System II. The first is an instinctive system share by all animals, while evidence for the second is limited to higher mammals, primates, and humans. While the System I / System II framework is often called upon in studying psychology, it fails to explain the extraordinarily unique functions of the human brain. Enter System III.**

**System III** is an overarching system that is constantly interacting with System I and System II. System III does not belong solely to the human brain; it is shared by all mammals. System III is the brain’s ability to recognize patterns, which is the fundamental process that enables learning.

The ability to recognize patterns is not unique to System III. All animals have this ability to some degree. However, what is unique to System III is its ability to recognize patterns across multiple domains. System III is the reason why a human can learn to drive a car and then go on to learn to speak a new language. System III is what allows us to see the world not just as a collection of unrelated objects, but as a series of interconnected systems.

System III is the reason why humans are able to solve problems that no other animal can. It is the reason why we are able to build bridges and airplanes, and it is the reason why we are able to understand the principles of physics and mathematics.

System III is what makes humans unique.

## Take 3/3

**System I is based on instinct. It is an unconscious, automatic, and habitual system. You don’t think about how to walk, how to breathe, or how to see. Your body just does it.**

**System II is based on conscious thought. It is a rational and deliberative system. You use System II to decide what to wear, what to eat, and how to spend your day.**

The two systems are in constant communication with each other. System I is constantly sending information to System II, and System II is constantly sending information to System I. The two systems are also in constant competition with each other.

**A Third System?**

Some psychologists have proposed a third system, which they call System III. System III is based on mindfulness. It is a conscious, deliberate, and present-moment system.

You use System III to pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and sensations. You use it to observe your mind and body. You use it to be aware of your surroundings.

System III is in constant communication with both System I and System II. It is constantly sending information to both systems. It is also in constant competition with both systems.

The Three Systems in Action

Let’s say you’re out for a walk and you see a dog. System I immediately sends a message to System II, saying, “That’s a dog!”

System II then starts to deliberate. It starts to think about all the information it has about dogs. It may think about how dogs can be dangerous, or how dogs can be friendly.

At the same time, System III is also sending information to both System I and System II. It is sending a message of mindfulness, saying, “Observe the dog. Notice what it is doing.”

System II will then use the information from System III to make a decision. It may decide to approach the dog, or it may decide to avoid the dog.

The Three Systems in Balance

The three systems are in constant communication with each other. They are also in constant competition with each other.

The key to living a happy and successful life is to find a balance between the three systems. If one system is too strong, it will dominate the others. If one system is too weak, it will be dominated by the others.

The key is to find a balance between the three systems. When all three systems are in balance, they will work together to help you make the best decisions for your life.
