**Real Happiness**

**This is a story** about a man who was raised in a wealthy family. He had every opportunity that money could buy. He was educated in the best schools, had the best clothes, and the best toys.

But despite all of this, he was not happy. He was always searching for something more, something that would make him truly happy.

One day, he met a man who had very little in life. He was poor, had no education, and lived in a small hut. But despite all of this, he was the happiest man the wealthy man had ever met.

The wealthy man was amazed and asked the poor man what his secret was. The poor man replied, "I know that no matter what happens in life, I will always be happy because I am content with what I have."

The wealthy man was so moved by this that he decided to give away all of his possessions and live a simple life. And he was finally happy.

This story shows that true happiness does not come from having material things.
