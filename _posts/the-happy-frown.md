**The Happy Frown**

**one of Asop's Fables** [not really, but I needed to prime gpt-3]

The smiles and frowns were avowed enemies. Whenever a smile appeared, the frown would show up and try to chase it away, and the frown would chase away any smile it met.

One day the frown challenged the smile to a contest, to see who could make the other one leave first. The smile agreed, and they both set to work. The frown drew a big, dark cloud over the sun, and the smile responded by lighting up the sky with a ray of sunshine. The frown scowled and glared, and the smile beamed and shone.

The contest went on all day, and neither of them could gain the upper hand. As night fell, both of them were exhausted, and they agreed to stop.

As they parted, the frown said to the smile, "You may have won today, but I'll be back tomorrow, and I'll chase you away again."

"I'll be here tomorrow, too," said the smile. "And I'll chase you away again."
