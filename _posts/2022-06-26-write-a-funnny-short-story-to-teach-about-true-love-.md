**Write a funnny short story to teach about true love:**

When I was younger, I used to believe in true love. I would daydream about my perfect prince charming who would sweep me off my feet and we would live happily ever after. I’m not sure what led me to believe in this fairytale, but I held onto the hope that one day it would come true for me.

As I got older, I started to realize that true love wasn’t always as perfect as I had imagined. I began to see all the ways that people could hurt each other in the name of love. I saw how love could make people do things that they never thought they were capable of.

But even though I saw all of these imperfections, I still couldn’t help but believe in true love. I wanted to believe that despite all of the pain and hurt in the world, there was still something beautiful and pure out there.

And then one day, I met him. He was everything I had ever dreamed of and more. He was kind, gentle, and loving. I felt like I had finally found my prince charming.

But as time went on, I started to see his imperfections. I saw how he could be selfish and how he could hurt me. But even though I saw all of these things, I still loved him.

Because I realized that true love isn’t perfect. It’s messy and complicated and sometimes it hurts. But it’s also beautiful and worth fighting for.

And so I continue to believe in true love, even though I know that it’s not perfect. Because I know that perfect or not, it’s still the best thing in the world.
