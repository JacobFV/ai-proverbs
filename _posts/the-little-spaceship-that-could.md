**The Little Spaceship that Could**

This is a story about a little spaceship that is trying to find a new planet to live on. The spaceship is running out of fuel, and it doesn't know where to go. The spaceship's computer is broken, so it can't find the way.

The spaceship is about to give up when it sees a star in the distance. The star is shining brightly, and the spaceship feels drawn to it. The spaceship uses the last of its fuel to reach the star.

When the spaceship gets to the star, it finds a planet that is perfect for life. The spaceship is happy to have found a new home.

The moral of the story is that even when things are tough, you should never give up.
