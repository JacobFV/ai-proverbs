**Five Fingers and One Thumb**

This is a story about a hand with five fingers and one thumb. The hand is always getting made fun of by the other hands because it is different. The hand is tired of being teased, so it decides to go on an adventure.

The hand climbs a mountain and meets a bird. The bird shows the hand how to fly. The hand is so excited that it starts to fly all over the place. The hand doesn't care that it is different anymore.

The moral of the story is that it's okay to be different.
