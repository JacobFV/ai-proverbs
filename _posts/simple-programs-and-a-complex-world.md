**Simple programs and a complex world**

This is a story about a computer programmer who is trying to create a simple program that can understand the complex world. The programmer works day and night, but no matter how hard he tries, he can't seem to get the program to work.

The programmer is about to give up when he has a sudden insight. He realizes that the world is too complex for any one program to understand. However, he also realizes that by creating many simple programs, each of which understands a small part of the world, he can create a system that can understand the world as a whole.

The programmer is happy to have found a way to create a program that can understand the complex world.

The moral of the story is that complex problems can be solved by breaking them down into smaller pieces.
