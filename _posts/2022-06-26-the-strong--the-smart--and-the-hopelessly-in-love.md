**The strong, the smart, and the hopelessly in love**

This is a story about three friends: a strong man, a smart woman, and a hopelessly in love man. The three friends are walking through the forest when they come to a river. The strong man says that he can cross the river without getting wet. The smart woman says that she can cross the river without getting wet or being carried by the strong man. The hopelessly in love man says that he will cross the river if the smart woman will hold his hand.

The three friends start to cross the river, and the strong man and the smart woman make it to the other side without getting wet. However, the hopelessly in love man gets half way across the river and then starts to drown. The smart woman has to go back and save him.

The moral of the story is that love is not always enough.
