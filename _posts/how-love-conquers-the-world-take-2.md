**Write a sweet fable about how unselfish love conquers the world:**

This is a story about how unselfish love conquers the world. It was once upon a time that the world was full of hate and darkness. People were fighting and killing each other for no reason. Then one day, a woman named Sarah came along. She was different from everyone else. She had a heart full of love and compassion. She showed everyone how to love and be loved. She showed them how to be unselfish and care for others. **Some people** didn’t believe her at first, but eventually they saw the truth in her words. They saw that her love was real and it was powerful. It was so powerful that it started to change the world. The hate and darkness started to disappear and people started to live in peace and harmony. **There are still some people** who don’t believe in love, but Sarah continues to show them the power of unselfish love. And one day, she knows that her love will conquer the world.
