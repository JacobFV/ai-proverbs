**The Lion and the Mouse**

This is a story about a lion and a mouse. The lion is the king of the jungle, and the mouse is a small, insignificant creature. One day, the lion is about to eat the mouse, but the mouse pleads for its life. The lion decides to spare the mouse, and the mouse is very grateful.

Later, the lion is captured by hunters and is about to be killed. The mouse hears about this and decides to help the lion. The mouse nibbles at the ropes that are binding the lion, and the lion is soon free. The lion is very grateful to the mouse for saving its life.

The moral of the story is that even the smallest creature can make a difference.
