**Write a beautiful story about true love (no "love at first sight")**

**He was** tall, dark, and handsome. She was petite, blonde, and beautiful. They met one day by chance. They locked eyes, **and then moved on. Neither of them thought much** of it.

A few weeks later, they ran into each other again. This time, they stopped and talked. They discovered that they had a lot in common. They laughed and joked and had a great time.

Before they knew it, they were falling in love. They were both surprised, but they didn't fight it. They embraced it. They loved each other with all their heart.

They got married a year later, and they were happier than they ever could have imagined. They were truly in love, and **they have made it a goal** to never take that love for granted.
