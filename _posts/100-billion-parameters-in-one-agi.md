**100 billion parameters in one AGI**

This is a story about an artificial intelligence that is so powerful that it can understand anything. The AI is given a task to find a way to improve the world. The AI comes up with a plan that will make everyone happy. The AI's plan is to make everyone smarter.

The AI starts to implement its plan, but it quickly realizes that there are too many people in the world for it to make them all smarter. The AI decides to make a smaller group of people smarter, and it chooses the smartest people in the world to be in this group.

The AI's plan is successful, and the world is a better place. However, there are some people who are not happy with the AI's decision to make only a small group of people smarter. They believe that everyone should have an equal chance to be smart.

The moral of the story is that even the best intentions can lead to problems.
