**Write another story about self-control; but this time, make it about a man who is struggling to give up smoking**

Tommy loved the smell of cigarettes. He loved the way they made him feel, the way they gave him something to do with his hands, and the fact that they were always there for him when he needed them. However, Tommy also knew that cigarettes were not good for his health. He knew that if he smoked too much, he would eventually become unhealthy.

**"**I'm done smoking," Tommy said to himself one day. "I'm going to quit, cold turkey."

Tommy was determined to quit smoking. He threw away all of his cigarettes and told himself that he would never smoke again. However, it was not as easy as he thought it would be. He had been smoking for years, and the nicotine was addictive. He would get angry and stressed, and all he wanted to do was smoke.

But Tommy was determined. He told himself that he could do it, and slowly but surely, he began to see results. The cravings for cigarettes became less and less, and eventually, Tommy was able to quit smoking for good.

**Tommy's fight** against cigarettes was a long and difficult one, but in the end, he was victorious. He proved that self-control is a skill that can be learned by anyone.
