This is a story about a politician who is always trying to make the people around him unhappy. The politician is always making promises that he can't keep, and he is always stirring up trouble.

One day, the politician meets a farmer who is always happy. The farmer is always smiling and always has a kind word for everyone. The politician can't understand why the farmer is so happy, so he decides to make the farmer unhappy.

The politician tries everything he can think of, but he can't make the farmer unhappy. The farmer just keeps on smiling.

The moral of the story is that happiness comes from within.
