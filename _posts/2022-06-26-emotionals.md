**Emotionals**

**This is a story about a special kind of animals that are called "emotionals".** Emotionals are animals that can feel all of the emotions that humans feel. They are very sensitive, and they can even cry.

One day, a group of emotionals is captured by humans. They are put in a circus, and they are made to perform for the humans. The emotionals are very sad, and they want to go home.

One day, a little girl comes to see the circus. She sees the emotionals, and she feels sorry for them. She decides to help them escape.

The little girl takes the emotionals home, and she takes care of them. She loves them, and they love her too.

**The moral** of the story is that we should all be kind to animals, because they are just like us. They have the same feelings, and they deserve to be treated with respect.
