**Write a story about forgiveness:**

Though they had been married for years, John and Jane had grown apart. They loved each other, but they just didn't seem to have anything in common anymore. One day, John came home and found Jane packing her bags.

**"**I'm leaving you, John," she said. "I'm sorry, but I just can't do this anymore."

John was heartbroken, but he knew it was for the best. He helped Jane pack her things and waved goodbye as she drove away.

A few weeks later, John got a call from Jane. She was in tears and she needed his help. Her car had broken down and she was stranded. John didn't hesitate to go and help her.

When he arrived, they hugged each other and tears of forgiveness flowed. They both realized that they still loved each other deeply and they decided to try again. They went home and started their life anew, vowing to never let anything come between them again.
