**The iPhone and the Android**

This is a story about two friends, an iPhone and an Android. The iPhone is always bragging about how much better it is than the Android. The Android is tired of the iPhone's bragging, so it challenges the iPhone to a race. The iPhone agrees, and the two friends start to race.

The iPhone is confident that it will win, but the Android is faster and soon starts to pull ahead. The iPhone starts to panic and uses all of its battery power to try to catch up. The iPhone runs out of power before it can cross the finish line, and the Android wins the race.

**The moral of the story** is that it's not about being the best, it's about doing your best.
