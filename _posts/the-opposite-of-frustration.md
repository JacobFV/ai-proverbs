**The opposite of frustration**

This is a story about a man who is always frustrated. The man is always angry and doesn't know how to enjoy life. One day, the man meets a woman who is always happy. The woman is always smiling and always seems to be enjoying life.

The man can't understand why the woman is so happy, so he starts to ask her questions. The woman tells the man that she has learned to accept the things that she can't change and to focus on the things that she can change. The man is amazed by the woman's wisdom and decides to try to change his own life.

The moral of the story is that it is important to focus on the things that you can change and to accept the things that you can't change.
